# KeyboardTranslator

Maps different keystrokes to user-set characters.

There are many different use-cases for the application, most notably with languages and special characters.

For example, I could map the 'a' key to 'á' to easily type in accents. I could also map the '$' character to '€' to easily type the Euro symbol.

The default mappings are as follows:

```
a:á
e:é
i:í
o:ó
u:ú
n:ñ
A:Á
E:É
I:Í
O:Ó
U:Ú
N:Ñ
?:¿
!:¡
>:→
p:π
-:—
c:©
=:≈
$:€
```

The user may change, add, and remove mappings.

If you're interested, you may download the latest release of the application.

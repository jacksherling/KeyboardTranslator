# KeyboardTranslator

Maps different keystrokes to user-set characters.

There are many different use-cases for the application, most notably with languages and special characters.

For example, I could map the 'a' key to 'á' to easily type in accents. I could also map the '$' character to '€' to easily type the Euro symbol.

If you're interested, you may download the latest release of the application.
